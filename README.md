# Yahtzee

# Description:
This program is designed to emulate a game of Yahtzee. Players are able to 
roll their dice, select a category to assign their score and then keep rolling 
until the game is complete, at which point they have the option to play again.

# Instructions:
When the program is launched, acceptable user inputs will be displayed and the 
user will be asked if they are "ready". To start the game, the user enters "y" 
or the user can enter "n" and the program will end.
Once the game begins, the dice will be displayed and the user will be asked to 
chose a category that has not been selected yet to score. Players have various 
options for viewing their score including:
*   "cc" for categories you've scored in or,
*   "co" for categories that are still open.
*   "s" or "score" for your current total score.

**It is recommended to enter "co" after the dice have rolled to view the scoring**
**potential of each open category.**

In addition to the above, players may enter:
*  "d" to view the dice again,
*  "i" to view the instructions or,
*  "q" to quit the game.

The game will repeat until each category has been chosen or until the user has
quit. Once the game is over, the final scorecard and total score will be 
displayed, and the user will be asked if they would like to play again. Again, 
the user will enter "y" to play another game or "n" to exit the program.
